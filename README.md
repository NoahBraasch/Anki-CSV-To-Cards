# Anki-CSV-To-Cards

This is a program I wrote to convert a list of the 12k most frequent words found on Japanese netflix, into Anki cards that I can study. Im not very experienced with python so this has been an interesting challenge.

## Running from VS Code

When running, this code simulate keyboard inputs by the `pyautogui` library and manually fills the fields of the flashcards

There is certainly a faster way to do this. But I have only written very limited amounts of python in the past so this was sufficient for myself.
